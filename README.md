# Overview

I decided to learn Julia. So I did. This basic calculator shows some of the basic and unique components of the Julia Language. 

The Calculator is split into 3 major parts; first, the function definitions that will define basic arithmatic for the claculator; second the demonstration of Julia's "Multiple Dispatch" as a substitute for object oriented programming; and third, the calculator logic. Which will guide the user through the terminal calculator experience. 

I think Julia is as intuitive as Python with all the versatility and power of C. I think it may grow to be a very popular all purpose language in time so I figured I'd get ahead of the game and spend some time learning it.

# Future Work

- As of now this calculator onlt does basic arithmetic. More functionality will be added. 
- Add a GUI for users. 
- Add functions and multiple dispatch for points and lines for graphing.
